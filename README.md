# Django Rwanda Portal

# Overview

**Django Rwanda Portal** is an open-source project designed to foster collaboration and knowledge sharing within the Django community in Rwanda. It provides a modular and **scalable system** built with Django, structured into reusable applications and layers for clean architecture, maintainability, and community-driven contributions.

The system emphasizes:

- **Layered architecture** for separation of concerns.

- **Reusability & DRY principles.**

- **Community collaboration** through well-documented code and contribution guidelines.

---

## Purpose

- Serve as a **reference architecture** for Django projects in Rwanda.

- Provide contributors a structured and organized system to learn from and extend.

- Implement real-world features like **user management, posts, notifications, messaging, events, and media handling**.

- Encourage collaboration, testing, and maintainability within the Django community.

---

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following primary layers:

| **Layer / Directory** | **Purpose** |
|------------------------|-------------|
| **src/api** | API layer exposing versioned REST endpoints (`v1/`). Handles routing and schema definitions. |
| **src/apps/*** | Domain-specific applications (`users`, `posts`, `analytics`, `messaging`, `notifications`, `media`, `comments`, `tags`, `events`). Each app includes its own models, serializers, views, services, tests, etc. |
| **src/common** | Shared templates, static files, and reusable email templates. |
| **src/config** | Django project configuration (settings for `dev`, `prod`, `staging`, `test`), URL routing, WSGI/ASGI entry points, and Celery integration. |
| **src/core** | Core infrastructure utilities: database mixins, middleware, security helpers, constants, and exceptions. |
| **docker/** | Docker setup with `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, and Nginx configuration. |
| **infra/** | Infrastructure-related configuration (future use for deployments). |
| **scripts/** | Automation scripts for project setup and maintenance. |
| **docs/** | Documentation for apps, layers, and developer guides. |
