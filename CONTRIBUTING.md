## Code Standards

- Follow PEP8 and Python best practices.

- Use type hints where appropriate.

- Format code with:

    - black for code formatting

    - isort for imports

    - ruff for linting and quality checks

- Place app-specific logic in `src/apps/<app-name>`.

- Place shared infrastructure logic in `src/core/`.

- Follow modular conventions in `src/api/` for API endpoints and routers.

---

## Testing Guidelines

- Tests are located under each app in tests/.

- Run all tests:

```bash
python src/manage.py test
# or if using pytest
pytest
```
- Include tests for:

    - Unit tests for models, serializers, and services

    - Integration tests for API endpoints

    - Functional tests for workflows

- Aim for good coverage, especially for new features.
